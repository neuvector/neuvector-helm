A new feature has been added as part of Controller and Enforcer to detect the K8s runtime automatically on version 5.3.0. 
This document briefly explains how this feature works and how we can manually configure runtime.

Neuvector Enforcer/Controller identifies runtime engine in the following order,

1. Mounted path from the YAML config, Eg. "/run/runtime.sock"

2. From kubelet process: Eg. --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock

3. Iterate known runtime socket locations: Eg. "docker/dockershim" ->  "k3s/containerd" -> "crio"

4. Mounted paths: "/var/run/docker.sock" -> "/run/containerd/containerd.sock" -> "/var/run/crio/crio.sock"
